# vscode-toggle-max-editor README

This extension exposes the `togglemaxeditor.toggleMaximizeEditor` command that you can use to maximize/normalize an editor tab with a single key.

It currently uses existing commands which unfortunately only partially maximize.
The sidebar is hidden when maximizing.
